Filter the properties returned by the Wordpress rest api V2

## Deprecated

Since wordpress version 4.9.? wordpress includes the functionality provided by this plugin in the core of wordpress.

Checkout https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/global-parameters/#_fields for functionality included in the wordpress core,
they made it even better by filtering the amount of data pulled from the database.

This plugin will no longer be maintained since it has been superseded by the core functionality.

## Description

The [wp-rest-api-v2](https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/) returns a lot of properties.
It could be very useful (or mobile-data-friendly) to only return the properties needed by the application.

If you only want titles and links of some articles it doesn't make sense to return the content or the excerpt.

This isn't limited to posts, it also works on custom posttypes, categories, pages, terms, taxonomies and comments.

Instead of returning:

    {
      "id": 2138,
      "date": "2015-10-25T15:31:03",
      "guid": {
        "rendered": "http://worldofict.nl/?p=2138"
      },
      "modified": "2015-10-25T15:31:03",
      "modified_gmt": "2015-10-25T14:31:03",
      "slug": "rechtenvrije-fotos",
      "type": "post",
      "link": "http://worldofict.nl/tip/2138-rechtenvrije-fotos/",
      "title": {
        "rendered": "Rechtenvrije foto&#8217;s"
      },
      "content": {
        "rendered": ".. A lot of content .. "
      },
      "excerpt": {
        "rendered": " .. A lot of content ..."
      },
      "author": 2,
      "featured_image": 2139,
      "comment_status": "open",
      "ping_status": "open",
      "sticky": false,
      "format": "standard",
      //.. even more tags ....
    }

It can return (with ``fields=id,title.rendered,link`` as GET parameter)

    {
      "id": 2138,
      "link": "http://worldofict.nl/tip/2138-rechtenvrije-fotos/",
      "title": {
        "rendered": "Rechtenvrije foto&#8217;s"
      }
    }

### Notes

1. If you specify fields so it wouldn't return data the default response is send back to the client.
2. (for developers) something wrong with this plugin? [Github](https://github.com/svrooij/rest-api-filter-fields/)
3. If you liked the plugin [consider sponsoring me](https://github.com/sponsors/svrooij)

## Installation

Installing this plugin is really easy.

Just search the plugin directory for `rest api filter fields` and press install.
Or download it right from [Github](https://github.com/svrooij/rest-api-filter-fields/releases) and copy the `rest-api-filter-fields` directory in the archive to `wp-content/plugins/`.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you add data to the response

No, this plugin only removes entries.
When you want to add [featured_images](https://github.com/svrooij/rest-api-filter-fields/issues/5), I recommend using [better-rest-api-featured-images](https://wordpress.org/plugins/better-rest-api-featured-images/)

### How about nested propterties

You can filter on nested properties with a '.' like 'title.rendered'. Not sure if this also works on arrays. [Existing issues](https://github.com/svrooij/rest-api-filter-fields/issues) or [Submit issue](https://github.com/svrooij/rest-api-filter-fields/issues/new)

### Does this also work for my custom posttype

Yes, we picked 20 as priority (default = 10) for activating.
This mean this plugin is probably activated last, so all custom post types should already be loaded.
But this only works if you made it public for the api.
See [Adding REST API Support for Custom Content Types](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/extending-the-rest-api/adding-rest-api-support-for-custom-content-types/) for more information.
